##Project Details

###Aim
Build a weather application that retrieves and displays weather information for a given location.

###Description
Develop a console-based weather app using Java, allowing users to enter a location and view current weather details.

###Brief Description
The Weather App is an entry-level project designed to demonstrate basic API usage and data retrieval using Java. 
Developed during a Java Development Internship at CodeClause, this project aims to create a console-based and 
GUI-based application that allows users to enter a location and retrieve current weather information.

The application leverages the Openweathermap API to fetch real-time weather data, which includes temperature, weather 
conditions and  humidity. The project utilizes various Java technologies, including HttpURLConnection 
for making HTTP requests, JSON Simple Library for parsing JSON responses, and Swing for building the graphical user interface.

This project serves as a practical example of how to integrate external APIs into a Java application. It presents a 
foundation for learning about network programming, JSON data handling, and GUI development in Java.
